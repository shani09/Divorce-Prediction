# Divorce-Prediction
## Predicting Whether a Couple Feels Like Strangers
Jan 2023 - March 2023

Independent project as part of Workshop in Data Science course, received grade 96. 

Used survey data which consisted of ratings of statements regarding the relationship of the person answering the survey, and whether the couple got divorced or not. The project was later changed to predicting whether a couple 'feels like strangers living in the same environment' which was one of the survey statements, based on the other statements. 

The project involves exploratory data analysis, data visualisations, various machine learning classification methods, and more. 

Used Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
